# Hi there 👋
#### 🥜 I am working on to build nuts empire across the world, while preparing to land a job at FAANG, to gain experience on working big tech company to apply skills into my own projects in future ! 💻 

2019 - started coding on QBasic (yeah, I know, that was wrong decision)
2021 - moved to basics of Python
2023 - started over from scratch (HTML, CSS, JS, Git, and Python)
2025 - building Nuts store
